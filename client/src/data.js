      desc: "I only drink energy drinks when necessary, but this one is actually delicious, and doesn't taste at all like an energy drink. It's more like an Arnold Palmer. I love that it's non-carbonated too, because I tend to need energy drinks when I spend a lot of time sitting, and the bubbles upset my stomach. I would definitely recommend to others, including the other Rehab flavors.",

      desc: "This stuff is crazy good. I drink a few cups of coffee daily, so caffeine doesn't really affect me like it used to. This stuff is the only thing that I can feel the caffeine in. I can drink coffee before bed and it doesn't faze me but this stuff is great. I had a high stress, desk job and I would often get tired about an hour before I was off. This stuff allowed me to stay energized the whole time, without feeling hyper, and I didn't experience a crash later on. The taste is great, I love it!",

They kick me into gear with a serious boost of energy and I don't personally feel a crash. Obviously not the healthiest drink and I won't ever drink as a preworkout, but I definitely love this drink and flavor for a dose of around the house energy.",
